# AI-RealtyPro: Intelligent Property Insights

## Overview

AI-RealtyPro is an innovative platform that utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance the real estate experience. It focuses on providing personalized property recommendations and an intelligent virtual assistant for real estate queries, catering to both buyers and sellers by leveraging AI to streamline processes.

## Implementation Details

This implementation illustrates the initial setup and functionality of the AI-RealtyPro system, highlighting two primary features:

1. **Personalized Property Discovery**
   - The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user preferences and suggesting property recommendations accordingly. This feature involves filtering and analyzing property details to match individual needs, such as location, budget, property type, and bedroom count.

2. **Virtual Assistant for Real Estate Queries**
   - An LLM-powered virtual assistant is integrated, capable of processing complex queries related to real estate. It utilizes the OpenAI platform to provide accurate and informative responses, enhancing user interaction by offering real-time assistance.

### Directory Structure

The code for AI-RealtyPro is organized into directories and files as follows:

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all necessary Python packages needed for the application, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, langchain, and openai.
  
- **app.py**: The main application file, responsible for orchestrating the operations of the platform by interfacing with the utility modules for property recommendations and virtual assistant responses.

- **utils/**: Contains utility modules that implement core functionalities.
  - **property_discovery.py**: Handles the logic for providing personalized property recommendations by matching user input preferences against a set of property attributes.
  - **virtual_assistant.py**: Communicates with OpenAI's API to generate responses for user-submitted real estate queries, simulating a conversational agent.

## Required Setup

- **OpenAI API Key**: Ensure to set your OpenAI API key in the environment variables for accessing the OpenAI services.
  
- **Data Sources**: In a production environment, replace the dummy property data with a connection to a real database or API for property listings and real-time market data.

- **Environment Setup**: Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file to ensure all packages are available for running the application.

## Scalability and Future Enhancements

The current framework serves as a foundational step toward more advanced real estate applications empowered by AI. Future enhancements could include incorporating more comprehensive machine learning models, expanding the database of properties, and refining user interaction features for improved personalization and accuracy.

With this architecture, AI-RealtyPro aims to transform the real estate ecosphere by offering insightful, data-driven support backed with advanced AI technology.
